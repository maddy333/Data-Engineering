# Azure Multi-Layer Data-Engineering


## 1. Introduction

This document provides comprehensive documentation for an Azure data engineering project on Adventure works Dataset . The project demonstrates how to build an end-to-end data engineering solution using Microsoft Azure services.

## 2. Project Overview

This project implements a modern data platform on Azure that ingests, processes, transforms, and serves data for analytics purposes. The solution follows a medallion architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold) and leverages various Azure services to create a scalable and maintainable data pipeline.

### 2.1 Architecture Diagram

```
Raw Data Sources → Azure Data Factory → Bronze Layer (Azure Data Lake) 
                 → Databricks (Transform) → Silver Layer 
                 → Databricks (Transform) → Gold Layer 
                 → Azure Synapse Analytics/Power BI
```

### 2.2 Key Components

- **Azure Data Factory**: Orchestration and data movement
- **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2**: Data storage across the medallion layers
- **Azure Databricks**: Data processing and transformation
- **Azure Synapse Analytics**: Data warehousing and analytics
- **Azure Key Vault**: Secure credential management
- **Power BI**: Data visualization and business intelligence

## 3. Environment Setup

### 3.1 Azure Resources Provisioning

The following resources were created in Azure:

1. **Resource Group**: Contains all project resources
2. **Storage Account**: For Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2
3. **Azure Databricks Workspace**
4. **Azure Data Factory**
5. **Azure Key Vault**
6. **Azure Synapse Analytics Workspace**

### 3.2 Storage Configuration

The Data Lake was configured with the following containers:
- `bronze`: Raw data storage
- `silver`: Cleaned and validated data
- `gold`: Business-ready aggregated data

## 4. Data Pipeline Implementation

### 4.1 Data Ingestion with Azure Data Factory

1. **Linked Services**:
   - Created connections to source systems
   - Configured connection to Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2
   - Set up Key Vault integration for secure credential management

2. **Datasets**:
   - Defined source datasets for ingestion
   - Created destination datasets in the Bronze layer

3. **Pipelines**:
   - Implemented copy activities to transfer data from sources to Bronze layer
   - Added validation activities to verify data integrity
   - Set up scheduling and triggers for automated execution

### 4.2 Data Transformation with Azure Databricks

1. **Cluster Configuration**:
   - Created Databricks clusters with appropriate sizing
   - Installed necessary libraries and dependencies

2. **Bronze to Silver Transformation**:
   - Data cleaning and standardization
   - Schema enforcement and validation
   - Quality checks and error handling
   - Implementation of Delta Lake tables for ACID transactions

3. **Silver to Gold Transformation**:
   - Aggregation and business logic implementation
   - Creation of dimensional models
   - Performance optimization
   - Data enrichment

4. **Notebooks and Workflows**:
   - Developed modular notebooks for specific transformation tasks
   - Created workflows to orchestrate notebook execution
   - Implemented parameter passing between notebooks

### 4.3 Orchestration

1. **Azure Data Factory Pipelines**:
   - Master pipeline for end-to-end orchestration
   - Activity dependencies and control flow
   - Error handling and notifications
   - Integration with Databricks notebooks using Databricks activities

2. **Scheduling and Monitoring**:
   - Configured pipeline triggers (schedule-based, event-based)
   - Set up monitoring alerts
   - Implemented logging for auditing and troubleshooting

## 5. Data Modeling

### 5.1 Bronze Layer

The Bronze layer stores raw data in its original format with minimal transformation:
- Data organized by source system and ingestion date
- File naming convention: `{source}/{year}/{month}/{day}/{filename}.{extension}`
- Metadata capture for lineage tracking

### 5.2 Silver Layer

The Silver layer contains cleaned and validated data:
- Standardized schemas and data types
- Quality-checked and validated data
- Implementation using Delta tables for ACID compliance
- Partitioning strategy based on usage patterns

### 5.3 Gold Layer

The Gold layer presents business-ready data:
- Dimensional models for analytics
- Pre-aggregated tables for common queries
- Performance-optimized for reporting
- Security and access control implementation

## 6. Limitations and Future Improvements

### 6.1 Current Limitations

- Limited handling of streaming data
- Manual intervention required for certain error scenarios
- Performance bottlenecks in specific transformation steps

### 6.2 Planned Enhancements

- Integration with Azure Event Hubs for real-time processing
- Implementation of CI/CD for pipeline development
- Enhanced metadata management
- Advanced analytics with Azure Machine Learning

## 7. Conclusion

This project demonstrates a comprehensive Azure data engineering solution that follows industry best practices. The implementation provides a scalable, maintainable, and secure data platform that can evolve to meet changing business requirements.
